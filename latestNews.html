<p>
Boris Johnson is the first British prime minister with genuine journalistic experience, having been a reporter, columnist and editor. 
He knows from the inside what the press can achieve. From early in his career, he learned the dark arts.
Aware of the tricks of his old trade, he is doing everything he can to avoid being subject to their wiles. 
Don’t do as I once did, do as I now say. 
As the ultimate purveyor of fake news, he was not about to open the door to truth. To that end, he refused to be interviewed by the BBC’s Andrew Neil during the December general election campaign.
That proved to be something of a dry run for what has happened since. He is sealing himself, and his government, off from journalistic scrutiny. 
So his ministers are not only banned from appearing on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme but also the softish ITV show, Good Morning Britain. 
As for Channel 4 News, no chance. Special advisers are also banned from talking to journalists.

<p>
Donald Trump has called journalists and news outlets “fake news” nearly 2,000 times since the beginning of his presidency, averaging more than one daily broadside against the press over the last four years.
Moments after The New York Times issued the first of its reports chronicling the president’s tax filings, revealing that he paid a mere $750 in federal income taxes the year he ran for president, and again during his first year in office, he immediately dismissed them as “made up.”
“It’s fake news,” he told reporters at the White House on Sunday. “It’s totally fake news. Made up. Fake. 
We went through the same stories. You could have asked me the same questions four years ago. 
I had to litigate this and talk about it. Totally fake news. No.”
Then, he deflected blame, attempting to cast doubts about the legitimacy of the report with his own false claim.
“Actually, I paid tax, but – and you’ll see that as soon as my tax returns – it’s under audit,” he said. “They’ve been under audit for a long time.”
